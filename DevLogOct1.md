# Development Log 1
#### Stardate October 1st

Though this Log will primarily be used to record my progress and thoughts regarding the final project for this class, it will also be a sight to record general reflections on the course itself. In general, I'll divide it into three, and where relevant, four, sections: Course Reflections, To-Do List, Project Updates, and Conclusion(s).

## Course Reflections
Moving past the introduction to GitHub, Hypothesis, etc. we talked a bit about what Digital Humanities as a discipline is, is not, and could be. It came down to the fact that DH is quite subjective, and ultimately due to the fact that it relates to closely to technology, it is difficult to quantify as it is always changing. Perhaps DH is as much a methodology as it is a subject of study - it comprises ways to research and think about and write about topics long studied, and those ways are constantly developing as technology itself develops.

## To-Do List
My To-Do List is pretty basic for the next fortnight.
- Read and annotate readings for next class
- Think about possibilities for group projects
My presentation is in mid-late November, and as such I have plenty of time to prep for it.

## Project Updates
- The back of my brain was ruminating on possible projects for the bulk of the class, especially as so many of us are interested in social story telling as it relates to games, technology and language more broadly. It might be fun, if it is at all possible, to create an Ottawa based tabletop RPG, maybe with a single player Twine or Zork-like element to it to bring in the digital space. Then, we could have it playtested by a variety of people, and log choices that are made and more generally the way people interact with it. 
Collating those results could reveal something very interesting about the ways people view and interact with Ottawa. What places in the city do people deem important/culturally relevant? How do people interact with those spaces? Are some places considered "sacred" and not to be interacted with? Those sort of questions, about how people interact with Ottawa/Ottawa history, could be answered or maybe just analyzed with Digital Humanities technology.

## Conclusions
It's still early days so I don't have any real preliminary conclusions, but it will certainly be interesting to see how we can possibly bring all our interests in, or at least as many as possible.
